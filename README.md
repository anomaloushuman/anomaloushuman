# Milestone 01 - Founded Xymbi Corporation (2015)
üñ•Ô∏è Developed xyOS ‚Äì A Unified, Cross-Platform, Cloud-Based Operating System

From 2012 to 2016, while in high school, I developed xyOS, a custom-built multi-platform execution environment that seamlessly unified Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS applications into a single native operating system.

At its core, xyOS was a Linux-based OS that integrated and extended:
- Wine (Windows compatibility layer)
- Darling (macOS compatibility layer)
- Android Runtime (ART) & iOS Mach-O support
- Advanced game console emulation for PS2, Xbox 360, GameCube, and more
  
This resulted in a fully integrated OS capable of running applications from multiple ecosystems natively, without virtualization.

## Key Technical Achievements:
1. Unified Windows, macOS, Android & iOS Execution
   - Combined Wine‚Äôs NT kernel translation with Darling‚Äôs Mach-O binary support to allow applications from Windows and macOS to run natively.
   - Integrated Android Runtime (ART) and iOS ABI support, allowing native execution of mobile apps.
   - Implemented a shared binary translation layer that dynamically resolved system calls between Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.
   - Mapped NTFS, HFS+, EXT, and APFS file systems for seamless cross-compatibility.

2. Custom Kernel Modifications for Multi-Platform Support
Linux kernel modifications to support dynamic binary translation across:
   - Windows PE (Portable Executable) format
   - macOS Mach-O binaries
   - Android ART & Dalvik VM
   - iOS ARM64 binaries with syscall translation
   - Integrated a custom syscall proxy to allow Windows DLLs, macOS frameworks, and Linux shared objects (.so) to coexist.
  
3. Native Game Console Emulation ‚Äì PS2, Xbox 360, GameCube, and More
   - PlayStation 1 & PlayStation 2 ‚Äì Integrated PCSX2, dynamically patched for native performance on xyOS.
   - Nintendo 64 & GameCube ‚Äì Used Dolphin Emulator, enhancing OpenGL/Vulkan support for better game rendering.
   - Xbox & Xbox 360 ‚Äì Implemented a hybrid Wine-like translation layer to run XQEMU and early builds of Xenia, enabling execution of native Xbox/Xbox 360 games.
   - Sony PSP & PlayStation 3 (early builds) ‚Äì Experimental integration of PPSSPP and preliminary work on RPCS3.

## üî• Key Projects & Innovations

# üîπ Xymbi Corporation
Xymbi Corporation was a Houston-based startup focused on revolutionizing daily technology use. I developed an operating system called xyOS, which enabled users to run native Windows and Mac OS applications on the same system. While out seeking investment at the NextGen Summit in Austin TX I fell victim to an attack which was premeditated. I came home to my system completely wiped and unbootable, years of dedication was wiped from my existence purposefully at the same time our website was hacked and taken offline. 
With an orchestrated hack such as one accomplished against me, I felt utterly defeated and gave up on the pursuit of a multi-dimensional Operating System that included translation layers for different operating systems and a hardware, a feat that took years to accomplish. To have internal and external systems disks completely wiped and a breach of that catastrophe led to the immediate halt on further development.

# üîπ NextGen AutoGlass
Disrupted the automotive glass industry with AI-driven service automation in the glass replacement industry. Providing service 24/7/365 on over 10K vehicles throughout the State of Texas for Hertz Rent-A-Car in 2020-2021 generating over 2.7M in revenue over its inagural 12 months of service existence.
