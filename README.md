## 🔥 Key Projects & Innovations

# 🔹 Xymbi Corporation
Xymbi Corporation was a Houston-based startup focused on revolutionizing daily technology use. I developed an operating system called xyOS, which enabled users to run native Windows and Mac OS applications on the same system. While out seeking investment at the NextGen Summit in Austin TX I fell victim to an attack which was premeditated. I came home to my system completely wiped and unbootable, years of dedication was wiped from my existence purposefully at the same time our website was hacked and taken offline. 
With an orchestrated hack such as one accomplished against me, I felt utterly defeated and gave up on the pursuit of a multi-dimensional Operating System that included translation layers for different operating systems and a hardware, a feat that took years to accomplish. To have internal and external systems disks completely wiped and a breach of that catastrophe led to the immediate halt on further development.

# 🔹 NextGen AutoGlass
Disrupted the automotive glass industry with AI-driven service automation in the glass replacement industry. Providing service 24/7/365 on over 10K vehicles throughout the State of Texas for Hertz Rent-A-Car in 2020-2021 generating over 2.7M in revenue over its inagural 12 months of service existence. 

# 🔹 TesseractOS
A custom-built Unix, non-POSIX compliant OS for real-time AI-driven automation.
Powers NextGen Services, integrating OCR, Object Detection, and AI-based automation.
TesseractOS: A decentralized AI bot capable of orchestrating system tasks via OpenStack kernel modifications.

# 🔹 Heimdall LLM
A custom LLM trained on 300,000+ vehicle parts and specifications.
Enhances accuracy in automotive part identification, reducing human error in procurement.

# 🔹 Patent-Pending LiDAR & Camera System
Fully automates vehicle identification, damage assessment, part ID, and service procurement.
Integrates OBD-II coding for ADAS recalibration.
Cloud-connected via satellite/cellular, powered by solar and battery tech.


## 🌍 Open-Source & AI Alignment
I believe in aligning technology with humanity for the better. My work with TesseractOS, RealmOS, and AI-driven automation is aimed at reducing inefficiencies and driving innovation in various industries.
